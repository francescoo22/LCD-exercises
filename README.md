## Exercise G

Show that the encoding of the operator Even in the mu-calculus captures the property of interest:

⟦Even(𝜑)⟧𝜂 = {𝑃 | ∀ complete computation 𝑃 = 𝑃₀ → 𝑃₁ → 𝑃₂ → ... ∃𝑖 s.t. 𝑃ᵢ ⊨ 𝜑}

## Exercise M

Discuss an extension of CCS with an operator of sequential composition between processes $P; Q$. Provide an operational semantics and analyze the possibility of having an encoding in CCS of the defined operator.
